             <h1>What is CpuHandler</h1>
                   <p>CpuHandler is an Android app. The idea is that user has to keep the whole power of Android kernel
                   in his hand. Find and install a kernel which has more features than the stock kernel. So, if kernel has extra features
                   then you can change clock frequencies (overclock) also user can create a profile with min &amp; max frequencies.
                   User can change cpu governor, change I/O scheduler and set ahead buffer size. Set on boot feature is available
                   in overclocking &amp; cpu governor. In future versions set on boot is going to settled in more settings. Another one feature is undervolting. User is free to collect info, check current frequency clock, how many cores running and check
                   battery statistics.</p>
